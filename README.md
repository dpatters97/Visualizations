# Visualizations
Two examples for visualizing point clouds and large graphs: one using Vispy in Python , and the other using Unity. To use the Unity example, first unzip the Lib.zip file as a folder named Lib. The Python file that the Unity example reads is called ipy.py (located in the Unity folder). No setup is required for the Vispy example other than having Vispy installed.

Note that a function in both examples use data from buildingparser.stanford.edu
